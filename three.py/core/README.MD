This code sets up the number of samples used for anti-aliasing in Pygame's OpenGL graphics rendering.

pygame.display.gl_set_attribute is a function in Pygame's display module that sets the value of a particular OpenGL attribute. The first line sets the number of multi-sample buffers to 1, which means that Pygame will use one buffer for multi-sampling. The second line sets the number of samples per pixel to 4, which means that each pixel will be sampled 4 times for anti-aliasing.

Anti-aliasing is a technique used to smooth out jagged edges in computer graphics by adding intermediate colors or shades between the edges and the background. Multi-sampling is a type of anti-aliasing that involves sampling multiple points within each pixel and averaging the results to produce a smoother appearance.

By setting these OpenGL attributes, the Pygame program will use anti-aliasing with 4x multi-sampling, which should result in smoother graphics with less jagged edges.
